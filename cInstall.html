&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#launching-tunnelblick">Launching Tunnelblick</a><br>
</p> 
<p>The Tunnelblick application contains the Tunnelblick GUI, OpenVPN, and OpenSSL, so no other installations are needed except for VPN configurations.</p>
<p><strong>Special note for those who may have installed RaptorVPN or Urban Shield VPN, VPN In China, or certain other VPN software</strong>: These installations have backups that must be removed before installing or reinstalling Tunnelblick unless you are continuing to use the same service. <a href="cUninstall.html">Uninstalling Tunnelblick</a> will remove these backups. See <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tunnelblick-discuss/s368xGP5Qpk/discussion">this Discussion Group thread</a> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Updating Tunnelblick</strong>: It is usually easiest to update using Tunnelblick's built-in updater (see the &quot;Preferences&quot; panel of Tunnelblick's &quot;VPN Details&quot; window), but you can install a new version of Tunnelblick without uninstalling the previous version; the previous version will be upgraded without disturbing your existing configurations and settings.</p>
<h2 id="download-tunnelblick-and-verify-the-download">Download Tunnelblick and Verify the Download</h2>
<p>First, download the latest disk image from the <a href="downloads.html">Downloads page</a>. If you need help deciding between the &quot;stable&quot; and &quot;beta&quot; versions, see <a href="cStableBeta.html">Stable vs. Beta</a>.</p>
<p>Next, <a href="downloads.html#verifying-downloads">verify the download</a>. This is an important step to ensure that the download was not damaged or deliberately modified en-route to your computer.</p>
<h2 id="install-tunnelblick">Install Tunnelblick</h2>
<p>Depending on your browser and its settings, you may need to double-click the downloaded .dmg file to mount the disk image. A window similar to the following will appear:</p>
<p><img src="/images/using-tunnelblick-dmg-2010-10-16.png" alt="Finder window showing a Tunnelblick icon labeled 'Tunnelblick' and a document icon labeled 'Online Documentation'"></p>
<p>To start the installation process, double-click the Tunnelblick icon and a new window will appear.</p>
<hr />
<p>If the window is similar to the following:</p>
<p><img src="/images/cinstall-02-app-store-only-2013-07-27.png" alt="window with text 'Tunnelblick.app can't be opened because it was not downloaded from the Mac App Store and a single button labeled 'OK'"></p>
<p>then your security settings do not allow you to open files that are not from the Mac App Store by double-clicking. You should click &quot;OK&quot; (the window will disappear), then Control-click the Tunnelblick icon and click &quot;Open&quot; to open the file. A new window will appear.</p>
<hr />
<p>If the window is similar to the following:</p>
<p><img src="/images/cinstall-06-from-internet-2013-07-27.png" alt="window with text 'Tunnelblick is an application downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?' with three buttons labeled 'Show Disk Image', 'Cancel', and 'Open'"></p>
<p>then click the &quot;Open&quot; button to continue. The window will disappear and a new window will appear.</p>
<hr />
<p>If the window is similar to the following:</p>
<p><img src="/images/cinstall-05-convert-configs-2013-07-27.png" alt="window with text 'you have one or more OpenVPN configurations that will not be available when using this version of Tunnelblick…' and three buttons labeled 'Ignore', 'Quit', and 'Convert Configurations'"></p>
<p>then you have OpenVPN configurations that have not been converted to Tunnelblick VPN Configurations.</p>
<p>Tunnelblick only uses Tunnelblick VPN Configurations because OpenVPN configurations are difficult to secure properly. When a configuration is converted, all of the original files used by the OpenVPN configuration are collected into the Tunnelblick VPN Configuration and then the Tunnelblick VPN Configuration is secured.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore</strong> will ignore any OpenVPN configurations. They will not be available for use in Tunnelblick — they will not appear in the list of configurations.<br></li>
<li><strong>Quit</strong> will quit Tunnelblick.<br></li>
<li><strong>Convert Configurations</strong> will attempt to convert your configurations before installing Tunnelblick. If the conversion fails, Tunnelblick will not be installed.<br></li>
</ul>
<p>Click <strong>Ignore</strong> or <strong>Convert Configurations</strong>. The window will disappear and a new window will appear.</p>
<hr />
<p>A window similar to the following window should now be displayed:</p>
<p><img src="/images/cinstall-03-must-be-in-apps-2015-07-27.png" alt="window with text 'Tunnelblick must be installed in Applications. Do you wish to install Tunnelblick. Type your password to allow this.' the window has two text boxes for entering a username and password, and two buttons labeled 'Cancel' and 'OK'"></p>
<p>If you are reinstalling, upgrading, or downgrading Tunnelblick, the window will show the version number of the current copy and of the new copy. The current copy of Tunnelblick will be put in the Trash before it is replaced.</p>
<p>The name and password of a computer administrator is needed to install Tunnelblick. Tunnelblick's imbedded OpenVPN needs root privileges because it needs to modify network settings by configuring new network devices, changing routes, and adding and removing nameservers. Because we don't want you to enter your administrator account name and password every time you start a VPN connection, Tunnelblick installs a program that allows it to start a VPN connection with super user rights. Tunnelblick uses your administrator account name and password so it can install this program. Tunnelblick also secures itself from being modified.</p>
<p>Click the &quot;Install&quot; button to install Tunnelblick to your hard drive. Conversion of OpenVPN configurations to Tunnelblick VPN Configurations, if requested, will be done before the installation so that if they fail the installation will not take place and any existing Tunnelblick installation will not be changed.</p>
<p>After the conversion and installation is complete (it should take only a couple of seconds to install Tunnelblick, but if conversions are done they can take tens of seconds), a new window will appear.</p>
<hr />
<p>If Tunnelblick is running, the window will look similar to the following:</p>
<p><img src="/images/using-tunnelblick-running-2010-02-06.png" alt="window with text 'Tunnelblick is currently running and two buttons labeled 'Cancel' and 'Close VPN Connections and Stop Tunnelblick'"></p>
<p>(Note: Connections marked &quot;automatically start when computer starts&quot; <strong>will not be closed</strong> and may interfere with the installation. You must close them manually.)</p>
<p>Click the &quot;Close VPN Connections and Stop Tunnelblick&quot; to continue. After all connections are closed and Tunnelblick has quit, the installation will proceed.</p>
<hr />
<p>When the installation has finished, a new window similar to the following will appear:</p>
<p><img src="/images/using-tunnelblick-launch-2010-10-16.png" alt="window with text 'Installation succeeded. Do you wish to launch Tunnelblick now' with two buttons labeled 'Quit' and 'Launch'"></p>
<p>Click the &quot;Launch&quot; button to launch Tunnelblick</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-first-time-tunnelblick-is-run-by-each-user">The First Time Tunnelblick is Run by Each User</h2>
<p>If this is the first time you have run Tunnelblick as a particular user, or the first time after certain Tunnelblick upgrades, the following window may appear:</p>
<p><img src="/images/using-tunnelblick-check-2010-02-06.png" alt="window with text 'check for updates automatically' with a checkbox labeled 'include anonymous system profile' which is checked by default and two buttons labeled 'don't check' and 'check automatically'"></p>
<p><strong>Tunnelblick checks for updates by making a request to the tunnelblick.net website</strong> each time it is launched, and every 24 hours thereafter while it is running. As part of its normal website operation, the website keeps a log which includes information about such requests; see <a href="cPrivacy.html#tunnelblick.net-privacy">tunnelblick.net Privacy</a> for details. If &quot;Include anonymous system profile&quot; is checked, Tunnelblick also sometimes includes information about your computer and Tunnelblick's settings in the request. You can see what information is included by clicking on the &quot;disclosure triangle&quot; to the left of the checkbox.</p>
<p>Specify whether or not you wish to have Tunnelblick check for updates each time it is launched. When an update is available, you will be given a choice of whether to install the update or not.</p>
<p>At any time after installation, you may check for an update by clicking the &quot;Check Now&quot; button on the &quot;Preferences&quot; panel of the &quot;VPN Details&quot; window.</p>
<hr />
<p>If this is the first time you have run Tunnelblick as a particular user, or the first time after certain Tunnelblick upgrades, the following window may appear:</p>
<p><img src="/images/cinstall-07-ip-check-query-2013-07-27.png" alt="window with text 'tunnelblick can check that the apparent public IP address of your computer changes when you connect to a VPN and warn you if it doesn't' and two buttons labeled 'do not check for a change' and 'check for a change'"></p>
<p>Checking if your computer's apparent public IP address changes when you connect to a VPN may help insure that your configuration is correct, and may help Tunnelblick diagnose DNS problems.</p>
<p><strong>Tunnelblick does this checking by making a request to the tunnelblick.net website</strong> before each attempt to connect to a VPN and after a successful connection is made. As part of its normal website operation, the website keeps a log which includes information about such requests; see <a href="cPrivacy.html#tunnelblick.net-privacy">tunnelblick.net Privacy</a> for details.</p>
<p>Click &quot;Check for a Change&quot; or &quot;Do Not Check for a Change&quot;, as you wish.</p>
<p>At any time after installation, you may specify whether or not Tunnelblick checks for a change on the &quot;Preferences&quot; panel of the &quot;VPN Details&quot; window.</p>
<hr />
<p>When there are no configurations (which is usually the case the first time Tunnelblick is run by each user when using a non-deployed version of Tunnelblick with no Shared configurations), the configuration helper will appear:</p>
<p><img src="/images/using-tunnelblick-welcome-2010-07-29.png" alt="window with text 'welcome to tunnelblick. there are no configuration files installed' and three buttons labeled 'Quit', 'I do not have configuration files', and 'I have configuration files'"></p>
<p>Click the appropriate button and the configuration helper will guide you through the installation of configuration files.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="launching-tunnelblick">Launching Tunnelblick</h2>
<p>To launch Tunnelblick after setting up configuration and other files, double-click Tunnelblick in the Applications folder.</p>
<p>If Tunnelblick is running when you log out, shut down, or restart your computer, it will be launched automatically when you log in. It will also be launched automatically if any VPNs are active when you log in. Otherwise you will have to launch it manually when you need it.</p>
<p>Tunnelblick requires few computer resources when no VPN is connected, so most people leave it running all the time.</p>
