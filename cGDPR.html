<h3 id="what-personal-information-is-stored-transmitted-or-processed">What "Personal Information" is stored, transmitted, or processed?</h3>
<p>The following "Personal Information" (as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation) is stored, transmitted, or processed when you access tunnelblick.net:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IP address</strong> The public IP address of visitors to the Tunnelblick website (<a href="https://tunnelblick.net" class="uri">https://tunnelblick.net</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>No "special categories of personal data" are stored, transmitted, or processed.</p>
<p>Other information may also be stored, transmitted, or processed, see <a href="https://tunnelblick.net/cPrivacy.html#tunnelblick.net-privacy">tunnelblick.net Privacy</a> for details.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-above-personal-information-stored-transmitted-or-processed">Why is the above "Personal Information" stored, transmitted, or processed?</h3>
<p>Processing the "Personal Information" is necessary for the performance of the following task carried out in the public interest: the distribution and functioning of the free Tunnelblick computer application which helps secure connections to the Internet:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The organization that hosts the website stores, transmits, and/or processes the "Personal Information" in the website logs to detect, analyze, monitor, and defend against attacks on and abuse of the website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tunnelblick developers store and process the "Personal Information" in the website logs to irreversibly anonymize the "Personal Information" (IP address) in copies of the logs that are kept by the developers to help analyze use of the website.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="where-is-the-above-personal-information-stored-and-processed">Where is the above "Personal Information" stored and processed?</h3>
<p>The above "Personal Information" is stored and processed in the United States of America.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-is-the-above-personal-information-stored">How long is the above "Personal Information" stored?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The organization that hosts the website stores logs containing the "Personal Information" up to two weeks. Other transaction information (for example, TLS handshake information) which may include "Personal Information" may be stored for longer periods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tunnelblick developers store copies of the logs containing the "Personal Information" for less than one minute. (Logs are downloaded and the "Personal Information" is immediately irreversibly anonymized by an automated system.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="with-what-third-parties-has-the-above-personal-information-been-shared">With what third parties has the above "Personal Information" been shared?</h3>
<p>The above "Personal Information" has not been shared with any parties other than Tunnelblick developers and the organization that hosts the website.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-request-a-copy-of-my-personal-information">How can I request a copy of my "Personal Information"?</h3>
<p>No copies of your "Personal Information" are stored by the Tunnelblick developers, so we cannot send you a copy.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-request-that-my-personal-information-be-removed">How can I request that my "Personal Information" be removed?</h3>
<p>Your "Personal Information" is automatically removed (replaced by an irreversibly anonymized token) within seconds of being downloaded by the Tunnelblick developers, so you do not need to specifically request that it be removed.</p>
<h3 id="personal-information-stored-transmitted-or-processed-by-others">"Personal Information" stored, transmitted, or processed by others</h3>
<p>"Personal Information" may be stored, transmitted, or processed by others when you access tunnelblick.net, including but not limited to:</p>
