<p>2017-09-27: <strong>The Tunnelblick website is now protected by Cloudflare</strong><br />
<a id="2017-10-03"></a></p>
<p>A small DDOS attack has been underway against the Tunnelblick website for the past two weeks. We have a small web server, so even a small attack can slow it down. We apologize for any slowdowns or loss of functionality that may have occurred.</p>
<p>As a result of this attack, the website can now be &quot;protected&quot; by Cloudflare. This protection may be turned on or off at any time without warning.</p>
<p>Whether or not protection is on, all accesses to the Tunnelblick website now go through Cloudflare, including browser access to web pages like this one and the Tunnelblick application's access to update information and IP address information. (That is how Cloudflare works — it is a &quot;man in the middle&quot;.) When protection is on, Cloudflare may supply responses it has cached from the Tunnelblick website, or it may pass on requests to the Tunnelblick webserver. Because the Tunnelblick website does not change often, Cloudflare's caches should always be up-to-date.</p>
<p>Cloudflare also now handles all DNS queries for tunnelblick.net.</p>
<p>Security implications:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In addition to the logging done by the Tunnelblick website host provider, Cloudflare does its own logging. This may include logging of DNS requests and logging of requests to the Tunnelblick website. See <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/what-cloudflare-logs/">What Cloudflare Logs</a> for details.</p></li>
<li><p>Cloudflare now has SSL certificates for *.tunnelblick.net. These certificates can be found on various Certificate Transparency logs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Tunnelblick's <a href="cPrivacy.html">Privacy and Security</a> page has been updated to reflect these changes.</p>

<p>These releases replace OpenVPN 2.4.2 with OpenVPN 2.4.3 and OpenVPN 2.3.16 with OpenVPN 2.3.17. See the <a href="https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/ChangesInOpenvpn24#OpenVPN2.4.3">2.4.3 change log</a> and the <a href="https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/ChangesInOpenvpn23#OpenVPN2.3.17">2.3.17 change log</a>).</p>

<p><em>From the <a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html">OpenVPN Downloads page</a>:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenVPN v2.4.2 was analyzed closely using a fuzzer by Guido Vranken. In the process several vulnerabilities were found, some of which are remotely exploitable in certain circumstances. We recommend you to upgrade to OpenVPN 2.4.3 or 2.3.17 as soon as possible. More details are available in our <a href="https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/VulnerabilitiesFixedInOpenVPN243">official security announcement</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[OpenVPN v2.3.17] is a minor release that mostly fixes the security issues mentioned in our <a href="https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/VulnerabilitiesFixedInOpenVPN243">security announcement</a>.<br />

<p>These releases replace OpenVPN 2.3.15 with OpenVPN 2.3.16 (<a href="https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/ChangesInOpenvpn23#OpenVPN2.3.16">OpenVPN change log</a>). (Also includes OpenVPN 2.4.2.)</p>
<p>The beta release also fixes an inability to install configurations that use OpenVPN's &quot;tls-crypt&quot; option.</p>
<p><em>From the <a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html">OpenVPN Downloads page</a>:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This [OpenVPN 2.3.16] is a minor release that fixes a few bugs. This release was made primarily because CloudFlare managed to serve obsolete pre-release OpenVPN 2.3.15 tarballs which lack <a href="https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/QuarkslabAndCryptographyEngineerAudits">the fix</a> for CVE-2017-7478. The official OpenVPN 2.3.15 Windows installers do have the fix. Nevertheless, you are advised to upgrade your OpenVPN installations to 2.3.16 or 2.4.2.&quot;</p>

<p>2016-01-29: <strong>Tunnelblick and the Sparkle Updater MITM attacks</strong></p>
<p>(Updated 2016-01-31 for clarification.)</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://vulnsec.com/2016/osx-apps-vulnerabilities/">blog post</a> says that OS X applications which use Sparkle Updater insecurely are vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack and that applications using older versions of Sparkle are vulnerable to a different attack. The post mentions Tunnelblick as one of the applications using Sparkle, implying that it is vulnerable to these attacks.</p>
<p>Tunnelblick is not vulnerable to the first attack because it uses <em>https:</em> for all traffic having to do with updates.</p>
<p>All versions of Tunnelblick prior to 3.6beta19 (build 4501) are vulnerable to the second attack. However, that attack requires compromise or impersonation of the official tunnelblick.net website. A new version of Tunnelblick without this vulnerability will be released soon.</p>

<p>2015-07-23: <strong>Tunnelblick website move completed</strong></p>
<p>Tunnelblick has completed the move from Google Code to a dedicated website at <a href="https://tunnelblick.net">https://tunnelblick.net</a>.</p>
<p><a id="2015-07-17"></a></p>
<hr />
<p>2015-07-17: <strong>Tunnelblick downloads on GitHub</strong></p>
<p>All Tunnelblick downloads (including updates) are now hosted by <a href="https://github.com/Tunnelblick">GitHub</a> on amazonaws.com.</p>
<p><a id="2015-07-14"></a></p>
<hr />
<p>2015-07-14: <strong>Tunnelblick launches new website</strong></p>
<p>With <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html">Google Code shutting down</a>, Tunnelblick needed a new home.</p>
<p>In the first part of a three-part move, the official Tunnelblick website has been moved to tunnelblick.net. The source code repository and issues will be moved from Google Code to GitHub sometime later this month; binary downloads will be moved some time after that.</p>
<p>tunnelblick.net has always been used by Tunnelblick to access information about program updates and to service Tunnelblick's IP address check facility, but the tunnelblick.net &quot;home&quot; page has redirected users to Tunnelblick's Google Code site. Google has announced that Google Code is being discontinued, so the site, source code, and Issues must all move. After careful consideration, GitHub was chosen as the home of Tunnelblick's source code and issues. Hosting the main Tunnelblick website independently instead of on GitHub is being done because most site visitors are interested in downloads and troubleshooting, not the source code or issues. GitHub is great for developers, but it isn't as friendly for these Tunnelblick users.</p>
<p>The goal of the new site is to be clean, easy to use, and &quot;trustworthy&quot; (literally: worthy of your trust). The site does not use Javascript or plugins, it does not collect personally identifiable information, and it does not store cookies or any other data on your computer. You can use your browser's &quot;private&quot; or &quot;incognito&quot; mode to keep your browser from caching site content or browser history. For more information about tunnelblick.net and privacy, see <a href="cPrivacy.html#tunnelblick.net-privacy">Privacy and Security</a>.</p>

<p>2014-04-08: Yesterday an OpenSSL vulnerability was disclosed (see the <a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20140407.txt">OpenSSL Security Advisory</a>).</p>
<p>Although Tunnelblick includes a version of the OpenSSL library which is vulnerable, James Yonan, creator of OpenVPN, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/openvpn/mailman/message/32199276/">has written</a>:<br />
 &quot;Using the tls-auth option should protect against this vulnerability (assuming that your tls-auth key is not known to the attacker).&quot;</p>
<p>A new version of OpenSSL which is not vulnerable has been committed to the Tunnelblick source code (as <a href="https://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/source/detail?r=2787">r2787</a>) and will be used in the next release of Tunnelblick.</p>
<hr />
<p>2014-04-01: Tunnelblick no longer loads an image fromPayPal when it displays an alert that an update is available; the image is instead loaded from tunnelblick.net (via https:). This was a change to the tunnelblick.net website, not the program, so it affects all versions of Tunnelblick. (Note: the image is a &quot;Donate&quot; button.)</p>
<hr />
<p>2014-01-16: <strong>Tunnelblick 3.4beta20 is <a href="downloads.html">available for download</a></strong></p>

<li>Checks and corrects ownership/permissions of launchd .plist files when Tunnelblick launches.</li>
<li>Adds a list of loaded non-Apple kexts to the 'Diagnostic Info'.</li>

<p>2013-12-18: <strong>Tunnelblick 3.4beta18 is <a href="downloads.html">available for download</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Includes a new status icon (the icon in the menu bar) more in keeping with recent OS X aesthetics and which includes Retina images. (The old icon may be selected as the 'Tunnelblick 3.3 icon' on the Appearance panel of the 'VPN Details' window.)</li>
<li>Changes to Tunnelblick's handling of computer sleep:
<ul>
<li>Adds a 'Disconnect when computer goes to sleep' checkbox on the 'Advanced' settings window; it is checked by default.</li>
<li>Before reconnecting any configurations after the computer wakes up from sleep, Tunnelblick waits for an Internet connection if checking that the IP address changed is allowed; or waits for a timeout period (the default is five seconds) if it is not.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Allows selection of the display on which notification windows will be shown if multiple displays are available.</li>

<li>Fixes a problem with connection restarts (caused, for example, by the OpenVPN --ping-restart option) by not starting OpenVPN with the -up-restart option. Note: the OpenVPN configuration must not contain the 'persist-tun' option or restarts will still fail. (The OpenVPN documentation seems to be incorrect with respect to these two options.)</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>2010-12-18: <strong>Tunnelblick 3.1.1 is available</strong>. Full details are in the <a href="cRlsNotes.html">Release notes</a>.</p>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>2010-10-31: <strong>Tunnelblick 3.1beta20 is available</strong>. Full details are in the <a href="cRlsNotes.html">Release notes</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed confusing question when Tunnelblick is launched and foo.tap and/or foo.tun (old Tunnelblick kexts) are loaded. The question asked if foo.tun and foo.tap should be unloaded. Now they are unloaded only as needed to make a connection: foo.tap is unloaded if net.tunnelblick.tap is being loaded for the connection, and foo.tun is unloaded if net.tunnelblick.tun is being loaded for the connection. The 'skipAskingToUnloadFooKexts' preference is no longer used. To override Tunnelblick's automatic loading of the tun or tap kexts required for a connection, see the following per-configuration <a href="cPreferences.html">Preferences</a>: &quot;-doNotLoadTunKext&quot;, &quot;-doNotLoadTapKext&quot;, &quot;-loadTunKext&quot;, and &quot;-loadTapKext&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>2010-10-16: <strong>Tunnelblick 3.1beta18 is available</strong>. Full details are in the <a href="cRlsNotes.html">Release notes</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>When there are more than eight configurations, the Details window changes to display a list of connections on the left side and a single tab with the log and controls on the right. This was done because of OS X problems when there are a large numbers of tabs. The 'maximumNumberOfTabs' preference specifies the maximum number of tabs to display; if there are more than that many configurations, the display will change as described above. The preference defaults to 8. Set this preference to 0 to always show configurations in a list on the left.</li>
<li>Streamlines installation by double-clicking to have only one dialog box explaining what will be installed and asking for admin username/password.</li>
<li>Fixes bug which prevented Standard users from installing Tunnelblick by double-clicking.</li>
<li>Fixes bugs in automatic installation of .tblks when installing Tunnelblick.</li>

<li>Includes localization-related code tweaks by Stefan Bethke and additional German localization by Stefan Bethke, Marcus Schneider, and 'Dr Hok'.</li>
<li>Fixes a formatting error when displaying file permissions in error messages about being unable to change permissions.</li>
<li>Fixes a problem causing a connection restart when 'Set nameserver' is used, a DHCP renewal occurs, and there are no WINS settings.</li>
<li>Fixes issues when using OpenDirectory and the user's home directory is on a non-Mac platform.</li>
</ul>

<li>Includes OpenVPN version 2.1.3.</li>
</ul>

<li>Fixes several bugs and includes a workaround for an OpenVPN bug.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>2010-07-29: <strong>Tunnelblick 3.1beta10 is available</strong>. Full details are in the <a href="cRlsNotes.html">Release notes</a>.</p>
<p>This beta includes an important bug fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes bugs in the shadow copy mechanism that caused connect failures, log-hookup failures, and (possibly) other problems. Thanks to Jim Bo for pointing out the first problem and suggesting a solution. The bugs were introduced in 3.1beta08.</li>
</ul>
<p>New features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configurations located in subfolders are displayed in submenus of the main Tunnelblick menu.</li>
<li>When a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration (.tblk package) is installed, all Tunnelblick VPN Configurations within it will be installed. If these 'inner' configurations are inside subfolders of the outer .tblk, they will be installed as subfolders of the configurations folders and will appear in submenus of the main Tunnelblick menu.</li>
<li>Automatic installation of configurations from the .dmg has changed: Only one Tunnelblick VPN Configuration (.tblk packages) in the '.auto-install' or '.auto-install' folders and their subfolders is installed.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>2010-07-10: <strong>Tunnelblick 3.1beta08 is available</strong>. Full details are in the <a href="cRlsNotes.html">Release notes</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to fixing bugs, this release adds several new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benji Greig has updated the Tunnelblick icon for Coverflow and created a distinctive icon for Tunnelblick VPN Configurations and a new background image for the disk image. Thanks, Benji!</li>
<li>Log processing and display have been rewritten:</li>
<li>Log files are created each time a connection is made.</li>
<li>When displaying the log, the entries are merged such that script log entries follow OpenVPN log entries that have the same date/time.</li>
<li>The log display now shows the most recent 10000 entries. Earlier entries are not displayed, but are in the log files stored in /tmp/tunnelblick/logs.</li>
<li>The DNS cache is flushed after a tunnel is established and after it is torn down. This is enabled by default but may be disabled by the per-connection &quot;-doNotFlushCache&quot; preference.</li>
<li>Tunnelblick VPN Configurations (.tblk packages) may now be shadow copied.</li>
<li>Configurations (.conf, .ovpn, and .tblk) may be stored in subfolders. Note that .tblk configurations are installed at the top level of the shared or private folder; they must then be moved to a subfolder if that is desired.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>2010-06-07: <strong>Tunnelblick 3.1beta06 is available</strong>.</p>
<p>This is mainly a bug-fix release, but it adds one new feature: It runs new scripts, pre-connect.sh and post-disconnect.sh, as root before connecting and/or after disconnecting if the scripts exist. (They must be in a .tblk package). This allows manipulation of kexts and/or the network configuration before the tun/tap kexts are loaded and OpenVPN is run and after OpenVPN exits and the kexts are unloaded.</p>
<p>The full list of changes is in the <a href="cRlsNotes.html">Release notes</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>2010-05-27: <strong>Tunnelblick 3.1beta04 is available</strong>.</p>
<p>This is mainly a bug-fix release, but there are some new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pipes for script output to &quot;Details&quot; window are created on demand instead of when Tunnelblick launches, so if you have 50 configurations, Tunnelblick won't create 50 pipes when launched.</li>
<li>A DHCP renew which restores the original DNS and/or WINS information no longer causes the connection to restart. This new behavior can reversed be by setting Tunnelblick the boolean preferences '-doNotRestoreOnDnsReset' and/or '-doNotRestoreOnWinsReset' to TRUE.</li>
<li>The up, down, and leasewatch scripts have been modified to implement options for the scripts which Tunnelblick causes OpenVPN to put first (before OpenVPN parameters) in the command line which starts the up/down scripts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full list of changes is in the <a href="cRlsNotes.html">Release notes</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>2010-05-14: <strong>Tunnelblick 3.1beta02 is available</strong>.</p>
<p>The full list of changes is in the <a href="cRlsNotes.html">Release notes</a>.</p>
<p>New features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tunnelblick VPN Configurations</strong>: All of the files associated with one configuration may be collected together and put into a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration. Tunnelblick VPN Configurations include features such as version control that make them easy to use for distribution to multiple Tunnelblick users.</li>
<li><strong>Shared configurations</strong>: Tunnelblick VPN Configurations may be shared by all users of a computer without being installed for each user individually. A button on the &quot;Details&quot; window switches a configuration from Shared to Private or Private to Shared.</li>
<li><strong>Connect when computer starts</strong>: Shared and Deployed Tunnelblick VPN Configurations may be set to automatically connect when the computer starts, before anyone is logged in. Such connections can persist through login and logout and may be controlled by Tunnelblick when a user is logged in.</li>
<li><strong>Tunnelblick deals with the .tun and .tap kexts more flexibly</strong>.</li>
